    <p>  When alpaca eat grass, they snip off the top of the plant unlike some other animals that pull the grass up by the root when eating. (Which is why they have a reputation for being good lawnmowers.)</p>

    
    <p>  Mothers almost always have their babies in the morning. This is also related to life in the high desert in South America where temperatures are very cold at night. By having their babies in the morning, the little ones will have the whole day to dry off, begin walking around, and nursing from the mother before the temperatures begin to drop.</p>
    
    <p> Llamas are large animals. They can be 6 feet tall (at the head) and reach between 280 and 450 pounds of weight.</p>
    <p>Llamas can be divided in two groups according to the length of their fur: short coated (called Ccara) and the medium coated (called Curaca). </p>
    <p> Llamas live from 20 to 30 years </p>
